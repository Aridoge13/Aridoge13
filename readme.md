# Hi, I'm Aritra Mukherjee 👋  
**Conservation Genomics | Pangenomes | Structural Variation | HPC-Scale Bioinformatics**

I work at the intersection of **evolutionary biology** and **large-scale computational genomics**, building reproducible workflows to study **genetic load**, **structural variants**, and **lineage divergence** in endangered mammals. My primary focus is on **pangenome-driven conservation genomics**, where long-read assemblies and graph genomes inform real-world management decisions (connectivity, hybridization risk, and genetic rescue).

💡 Motto: Do Only Good Everyday.
(That’s why the GitHub ID is Aridoge13.)

## 🔬 What I Work On
- **Conservation Genomics Pipelines**  
  Long-read genome assembly (Flye, hifiasm), SV detection (Sniffles2, SVIM), pangenome graphs (Minigraph/VG), deleteriousness scoring (CADD/SIFT), and genetic load estimation for non-model vertebrates.

- **Population & Evolutionary Genomics**  
  PCA, ADMIXTURE, ROH/FROH, phylogenetics, demographic inference, lineage assignment.

- **Reproducible Workflow Engineering**  
  Snakemake + SLURM, containerization (Conda/Mamba/Docker), cloud/HPC orchestration.

- **Machine Learning (Support Skills)**  
  I use ML primarily for **downstream interpretation**—feature attribution, risk scoring, and transparency for conservation decisions.

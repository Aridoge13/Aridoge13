**Computational Genomics | Data-Intensive Biology | Reproducible Systems**

I develop scalable computational methods and end-to-end workflows for extracting biologically meaningful insight from large-scale sequencing and multi-omics data. My work emphasizes robustness, interpretability, and reproducibility across diverse biological systems.

I am particularly interested in genome-scale variation, population and evolutionary processes, and the algorithmic challenges posed by modern high-throughput technologies.

💡 Motto: *Do Only Good Everyday.*

**Cancer Genomics | Tumor Evolution | Computational Modeling | Reproducible Bioinformatics**

I study cancer as an evolving biological system shaped by mutation, selection, immune pressure, and genomic context. My work focuses on building reproducible analytical frameworks that connect large-scale sequencing data with interpretable models of tumor dynamics. I am particularly interested in simulation-informed reasoning, clonal evolution, immune escape, and deriving biologically meaningful insights from noisy high-dimensional data.

💡 Motto: Do Only Good Everyday.  
(That’s why the GitHub ID is Aridoge13.)

## 🔬 What I Work On

### 🧬 Cancer & Evolutionary Genomics  
- Variant analysis, clonal structure inference, and evolutionary interpretation  
- Neoantigen-related genomic features and immune interaction signals  
- Population genetics concepts applied to tumor evolution  
- Phylogenetic reasoning for reconstructing lineage dynamics  

### 📊 Computational Modeling & Inference  
- Interpretable machine learning for biological data  
- Stability analysis and dataset-shift detection  
- Calibration and uncertainty-aware prediction  
- Temporal modeling and deviation-based inference  

### ⚙️ Reproducible Workflow Engineering  
- Scalable pipelines for large sequencing datasets  
- Snakemake + SLURM for HPC environments  
- Containerized analysis (Conda/Mamba/Docker)  
- Transparent, documented workflows  

### 🤖 Machine Learning for Biological Insight  
I use ML as a tool for understanding biological mechanisms, not as a substitute for them. Emphasis is on interpretability, robustness, and generalization rather than purely predictive performance.
